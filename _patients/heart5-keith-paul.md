title: The Absolute CVD Risk/Benefit Calculator. Calculate your own 10 year risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. Click on Qrisk2 to get British risk numbers.
description: You will need your age, sex, ethnic origin, smoking status, do you have diabetes?, your top (systolic) blood pressure, whether you are on blood pressure medicine, your cholesterol number, your healthy (HDL) cholesterol number, whether your parents or siblings had a heart attack, or angina, before 60, if you have chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation of the heart, rheumatoid arthritis and also your height (in cm) and your weight (in kg).  This computer programme will only work for you if you are 40 or above and donâ€™t already have obvious damage to your blood vessels (heart attack, angina, a stroke or narrow blood vessels to your legs). It does not work for those people who have familial hypercholesterolaemia (uncommon - 1 in 500 people).  The computer programme should give you a risk number. This is the chance that you might have a heart attack, angina or a stroke in the next 10 years. This is shown with red and pink faces. If your number is higher than 20% then you should definitely discuss this with your GP. If the number is 10-19% you should probably talk to your nurse.
