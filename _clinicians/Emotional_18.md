title: 31 Functional neurological symptoms
description: 31 This website is about Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). This is when someone has NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS (such as limb weakness, numbness, shaking or blackouts) which are REAL (and not imagined) and due to a PROBLEM with the FUNCTIONING of the nervous system not due to damage or structural disease of the nervous system causing difficulties for the person who experiences them. Some people have troublesome symptoms that they wish to understand without necessarily having a 'disorder' - these are called functional neurological symptoms, and this site is for you too. FND and functional symptoms surprisingly common but can be difficult for patients and health professionals to understand. This website, written by a neurologist with a special interest in these problems, aims to give you a better understanding of these symptoms. It has no advertising and is free. I hope you find it useful
